# Machine-Learning-Capstone
## Recommender Systems in Python
### Overview
This project explores the implementation of different machine learning algorithms to create recommender systems. We will compare and contrast methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to predict course ratings and enhance user experience.
### Objectives
Compare and Contrast Machine Learning Algorithms:
Understand the strengths and weaknesses of various algorithms used in recommender systems.
Implement collaborative filtering techniques and analyze their performance.
Create Recommendation Systems:
Apply KNN for user-based and item-based recommendations.
Utilize PCA for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.
Implement Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for collaborative filtering.
Predict Course Ratings:
Train a neural network to predict ratings based on user interactions.
Construct regression and classification models to evaluate the effectiveness of recommendations.
Implementation Details
#### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN is a simple yet effective algorithm for building recommender systems. It works by finding the closest neighbors to a user or item based on similarity metrics. In this project, we will implement both user-based and item-based KNN approaches.
#### 2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving variance. This technique can help improve the performance of recommendation algorithms by focusing on the most significant features.
#### 3. Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
NMF is a collaborative filtering technique that decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into two lower-dimensional matrices. This method is particularly useful for recommendation tasks.
#### 4. Neural Network for Rating Prediction
We will build a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras to predict course ratings based on user features and past interactions.
## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive overview of building recommender systems using various machine learning techniques. By comparing KNN, PCA, and NMF, we can gain insights into their effectiveness in predicting user preferences and enhancing the overall recommendation experience.
